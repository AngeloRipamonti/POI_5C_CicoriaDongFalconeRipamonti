The school was founded in 1973 with a temporary location in Husby and a few years later moved to Flensburg with the modern concrete building on Richard-Wagner-Straße in green surroundings. After 17 years as a so-called special school, it was only the change of government in 1988 and the new school law implemented by the new SPD state government in 1990 that allowed it to be classified as a normal school. At the beginning of the 2010/11 school year, Kurt Tucholsky School is officially a community school. In 1993 it was given the name Kurt Tucholsky. The initiative came from Marco Kühnert, a student at the time, in 1990/91. After long internal debates at the school, the school board decided to give the name against the declared will of the school management. The KTS currently has 1192 students in 50 classes that are divided into three school branches: the main school branch (5th - 9th grade), the secondary school branch (5th - 10th grade) and the high school branch (5th - 10th grade). The KTS offers a very wide and diverse range of foreign languages. Spanish can be chosen as a second foreign language in addition to Latin from the 7th grade. The KTS maturity corresponds to that of all other high schools in Schleswig-Holstein.",

The proximity to the water was the economic reason for the founding of Flensburg. For centuries the port remained an important factor in the growth of the city, especially through trade. Initially the tip of the port was located much more towards the south, but due to geological phenomena such as silting, the tip has moved further north. Today, the port is still active with unloading and loading of goods, between Germany and Denmark. In addition to being the center of these commercial activities, the port is also a destination for many tourists, who can stroll along the quays, enjoy the view of the sea and see the cruise ships or eat something typical since the port also has restaurants and bars. In the port there are also different types of ships such as: sailing, classic yachts, steamships and motor ships. The port is connected to the old town of Flensburg, with its cobbled streets, shops, restaurants and historic buildings. Walking along the harbor, you can easily access these picturesque areas, which offer a combination of traditional architecture and local culture.",

It was founded in 1876 and was used for exhibitions on the artistic and cultural history of the former Duchy of Schleswig. It consists of two palaces; the northern one has belonged to Denmark since 1920. The exhibition in the “Heinrich Sauermann House” illustrates the history of art and culture from 1500 to 1900. The original farmer’s living rooms and the collection of historical furniture, which numbers more than 900 pieces, is one of the largest of its kind in Germany. The exhibition of the "Hans Christiansen House" shows the art of Schleswig-Holstein from 1900 to 2000. The most important area is that of the Art Nouveau department with the main works of the painter Hans Christiansen, expressionist art thanks to the works of the painters Erich Heckel and Emil Nolde and the sculptor Emil Nolde, and finally contemporary art of the North. Special exhibitions with changing themes complement the permanent collection. We think it is an excellent tourist destination to come into contact with the history of German art of the last 500 years, being able to compare the works of different painters and sculptors. The museum also offers the possibility of learning activities for classes of students of all levels, presenting laboratory activities on the artists whose works are exhibited inside the museum.`,

The two side surfaces each contain two medium-sized square pictures arranged one above the other, each of which is surrounded by a frame of 16 small pictures. The upper floor is dominated by the painting of the Adoration of the Shepherds. It is flanked by two statues of women, the one on the left symbolizes hope with an anchor and a bird and the one on the right symbolizes faith with a cross and plaques of commandments.

As a result, the Braasch family decided to renovate and expand the museum whose modern architecture blends almost invisibly with the historic walls. In July 2014, the museum was reopened by Walter and Karsten Braasch and since then it has offered an insight into the transatlantic triangular trade, the history of Flensburg rum and the production and manufacture of sugar and rum. The first part of the museum can be accessed through two courtyards, a corridor to the left of the house or directly through the shop. In the 2nd courtyard, a large world map welcomes you outside, which gives you a first overview of the West Indies trade. In the basement you learn how sugar was searched for and how rum was found. Here you can see a real distillery and learn about the "three små øer", the former Danish colonies. You will get an insight into the production of rum and the dark side of the transatlantic triangular trade. Finally, upstairs every 15 minutes we show pictures of a trip to today's US Virgin Islands – the islands of St. John, St. Thomas and St. Croix.`,

All the buildings were built around 1770; the facade was rebuilt at the beginning of the 19th century. The building was home to merchant families. On the north side was the kitchen, additional rooms and storage rooms. On the opposite side were the stables. To the east, the courtyard is surrounded by a warehouse built in 1716 with a passage system and elevator, in which there were further storage rooms and stables. The farm was home to one of the oldest schnapps distilleries in the city: the “Bommerlunder” was produced here for the first time. In 1974, the farm was in a very poor condition and largely unused. The transverse basin near the harbour was showing signs of serious subsidence. Although at the time the building was located outside the first area designated for the redevelopment of the old town of Flensburg, it was nevertheless decided to prepare for the renovation. In Denmark, there is a long and unbroken tradition of renovating old buildings. During the renovation of the Kaufmannshof in 1975-76, 12 apartments and a shop were created. The success of this first renovation of a large merchant farm had a positive effect on the ongoing urban renewal process in Flensburg. Thanks to this history, the Kaufmannshof has remained a landmark to this day, and is still a showcase for urban redevelopment.`,
